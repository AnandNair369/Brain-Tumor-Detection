Brain Tumor Detection ðŸ§ 




Project Overview

This project focuses on automated brain tumor detection from MRI images using deep learning. It uses transfer learning with the EfficientNetB3 model and is designed to classify brain MRI scans accurately into tumor categories.

Key Goals:

Train a CNN-based model for tumor detection

Visualize model performance

Provide a ready-to-use saved model (Model.h5) for inference

Features

âœ… Download and preprocess brain MRI dataset from Kaggle

âœ… Data augmentation and normalization using ImageDataGenerator

âœ… Deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras

âœ… Transfer learning with EfficientNetB3

âœ… Training, validation, and testing pipelines

âœ… Visualize training history (loss & accuracy)

âœ… Confusion matrix & classification report

âœ… Save and reuse trained model
